            Kitfo is a traditional lovely dish of Ethiopian people. It is a
            widely known dish all over the country. It is a casual daily dish
            for most Ethiopians.

            Shiro is made of primarily roasted yellow peas powder. It looks some
            kind of porridge though not as thick. Shiro is commonly consumed
            with Enjera, another Ethiopian local flat bread, which looks like a
            spongy fermented pancake.
